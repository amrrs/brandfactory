# BrandFactory Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your API keys

# NOTE: This application stores API keys in the browser's localStorage
# No environment variables are actually required for the app to run
# Users will be prompted to enter their keys through the UI on first launch

# However, if you want to pre-configure keys for development, you can set them here:
# (These would need to be implemented in the code to be used from env vars)

# OpenAI API Key
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Required for: GPT-5.2 (prompts, analysis, copy), GPT-Image-1.5, Sora-2
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Fal.ai API Key (Optional - used as fallback)
# Get your key from: https://fal.ai/dashboard
# Used for: Fallback image and video generation if OpenAI fails
# FAL_API_KEY=...

# Notes:
# - Never commit actual API keys to version control
# - API keys are sensitive - keep them secure
# - Current implementation uses client-side localStorage for key storage
# - Keys entered through the UI are stored locally in the browser only
