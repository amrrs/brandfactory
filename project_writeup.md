# BrandFactory - Project Write-Up

**Problem:** Creating diverse marketing assets is expensive and slow. Brands especially Small and Medium Business who don't have access to Big Marketing Agencies struggle to create diverse, professional marketing assets quickly. Manual design is time-consuming and maintaining brand consistency across formats is challenging. BrandFactory automates the entire creative pipeline with human touch: upload one brand image, AI analyzes identity, generates optimized prompts for each platform, creates images/videos/carousels, predicts engagement, and provides brand strategy. 

**Solution:** BrandFactory uses OpenAI's GPT-5.2 reasoning, GPT-Image-1.5, and Sora-2 to transform a single brand image into complete asset suites. It analyzes brand identity, generates photographer-quality prompts, creates multi-format visuals (social, video, carousel), and provides engagement predictions plus strategic insights—all while preserving brand DNA.

**Impact:** Democratizes professional-grade creative production, reducing weeks of work to minutes with AI-powered brand intelligence.
